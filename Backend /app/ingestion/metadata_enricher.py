# 4. metadata_enricher.py (Optional)
# (Knowledge Control Layer)
# Purpose

# Add contextual intelligence to every chunk.

# What Metadata Includes

# Source (FAQ, policy, ticket, docs)

# Topic (billing, delivery, refund)

# Product or feature name

# Version or last updated date

# Access level (public / internal)

# 📌 Metadata decides:

# What content can be retrieved

# When it should be used

# Who it is safe for

# Why Optional?

# Small systems can handle metadata inside preprocessing.py

# Large systems benefit from separating this responsibility
